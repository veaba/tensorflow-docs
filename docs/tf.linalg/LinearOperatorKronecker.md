## Class LinearOperatorKronecker
Kronecker product between two `LinearOperators`.
Inherits From: `LinearOperator`
### Aliases:
- Class `tf.compat.v1.linalg.LinearOperatorKronecker`
- Class `tf.compat.v2.linalg.LinearOperatorKronecker`
This operator composes one or more linear operators `[op1,...,opJ]`, building a new `LinearOperator` representing the Kronecker product: `op1 x op2 x .. opJ` (we omit parentheses as the Kronecker product is associative).
If `opj` has shape `batch_shape_j + [M_j, N_j]`, then the composed operator will have shape equal to `broadcast_batch_shape + [prod M_j, prod N_j]`, where the product is over all operators.

```
 # Create a 4 x 4 linear operator composed of two 2 x 2 operators.
operator_1 = LinearOperatorFullMatrix([[1., 2.], [3., 4.]])
operator_2 = LinearOperatorFullMatrix([[1., 0.], [2., 1.]])
operator = LinearOperatorKronecker([operator_1, operator_2])

operator.to_dense()
==> [[1., 2., 0., 0.],
     [3., 4., 0., 0.],
     [2., 4., 1., 2.],
     [6., 8., 3., 4.]]

operator.shape
==> [4, 4]

operator.log_abs_determinant()
==> scalar Tensor

x = ... Shape [4, 2] Tensor
operator.matmul(x)
==> Shape [4, 2] Tensor

# Create a [2, 3] batch of 4 x 5 linear operators.
matrix_45 = tf.random.normal(shape=[2, 3, 4, 5])
operator_45 = LinearOperatorFullMatrix(matrix)

# Create a [2, 3] batch of 5 x 6 linear operators.
matrix_56 = tf.random.normal(shape=[2, 3, 5, 6])
operator_56 = LinearOperatorFullMatrix(matrix_56)

# Compose to create a [2, 3] batch of 20 x 30 operators.
operator_large = LinearOperatorKronecker([operator_45, operator_56])

# Create a shape [2, 3, 20, 2] vector.
x = tf.random.normal(shape=[2, 3, 6, 2])
operator_large.matmul(x)
==> Shape [2, 3, 30, 2] Tensor
```
#### Performance
The performance of `LinearOperatorKronecker` on any operation is equal to the sum of the individual operators' operations.
#### Matrix property hints
This `LinearOperator` is initialized with boolean flags of the form `is_X`, for `X = non_singular, self_adjoint, positive_definite, square`. These have the following meaning:
- If `is_X == True`, callers should expect the operator to have the property `X`. This is a promise that should be fulfilled, but is not a runtime assert. For example, finite floating point precision may result in these promises being violated.
- If `is_X == False`, callers should expect the operator to not have `X`.
- If `is_X == None` (the default), callers should have no expectation either way.

```
 __init__(
    operators,

    is_square=None,
    name=None

```
Initialize a `LinearOperatorKronecker`.
`LinearOperatorKronecker` is initialized with a list of operators `[op_1,...,op_J]`.
#### Args:
- `operators`: Iterable of `LinearOperator` objects, each with the same `dtype` and composable shape, representing the Kronecker factors.
- `is_non_singular`: Expect that this operator is non-singular.
- `is_self_adjoint`: Expect that this operator is equal to its hermitian transpose.
- `is_positive_definite`: E`x`pect that this operator is positive definite, meaning the quadratic form `x`^H A `x` has positive real part for all nonzero `x`. Note that we do not require the operator to be self-adjoint to be positive-definite. See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive-definite_matri`x`
#E`x`tension_for_non_symmetric_matrices
- `is_square`: Expect that this operator acts like square [batch] matrices.
- `name`: A `name` for this `LinearOperator`. Default is the individual operators `name`s joined with `_x_`.
#### Raises:
- `TypeError`: If all operators do not have the same `dtype`.
- `ValueError`: If `operators` is empty.
## Properties
### H
Returns the adjoint of the current `LinearOperator`.
