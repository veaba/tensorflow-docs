Represents a graph node that performs computation on tensors.
### Aliases:
- Class `tf.compat.v1.Operation`
- Class `tf.compat.v2.Operation`
An `Operation` is a node in a `Tensor`Flow `Graph` that takes zero or more `Tensor` objects as input, and produces zero or more `Tensor` objects as output. Objects of type `Operation` are created by calling a Python op constructor (such as `tf.matmul`) or `tf.Graph.create_op`.
