## Class  `CSVLogger` 
Callback that streams epoch results to a csv file.

Inherits From: [ `Callback` ](https://tensorflow.google.cn/api_docs/python/tf/keras/callbacks/Callback)

**Aliases** : [ `tf.compat.v1.keras.callbacks.CSVLogger` ](/api_docs/python/tf/keras/callbacks/CSVLogger), [ `tf.compat.v2.keras.callbacks.CSVLogger` ](/api_docs/python/tf/keras/callbacks/CSVLogger)

Supports all values that can be represented as a string,including 1D iterables such as np.ndarray.

#### Example:


```
 csv_logger = CSVLogger('training.log')
model.fit(X_train, Y_train, callbacks=[csv_logger])
 
```

#### Arguments:
- **`filename`** : filename of the csv file, e.g. 'run/log.csv'.
- **`separator`** : string used to separate elements in the csv file.
- **`append`** : True: append if file exists (useful for continuingtraining). False: overwrite existing file,
