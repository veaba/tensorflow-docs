### Aliases:
- Class `tf.compat.v1.keras.callbacks.EarlyStopping`
- Class `tf.compat.v2.keras.callbacks.EarlyStopping`
### Used in the guide:
- ``K``e``r``a``s`` ``o``v``e``r``v``i``e``w``
- ``T``r``a``i``n`` ``a``n``d`` ``e``v``a``l``u``a``t``e`` ``w``i``t``h`` ``K``e``r``a``s``
### Used in the tutorials:
- ``B``a``s``i``c`` ``r``e``g``r``e``s``s``i``o``n``:`` ``P``r``e``d``i``c``t`` ``f``u``e``l`` ``e``f``f``i``c``i``e``n``c``y``
#### Arguments:
- `monitor`: Quantity to be `monitor`ed.
- `min_delta`: Minimum change in the `monitor`ed quantity to qualify as an improvement, i.e. an absolute change of less than `min_delta`, will count as no improvement.
- `patience`: Number of epochs with no improvement after which training will be stopped.
- `verbose`: verbosity mode.
- `mode`: One of `{"auto", "min", "max"}`. In `min` `mode`, training will stop when the quantity `monitor`ed has stopped decreasing; in `max` `mode` it will stop when the quantity `monitor`ed has stopped increasing; in `auto` `mode`, the direction is `auto`matically inferred from the name of the `monitor`ed quantity.
- `baseline`: Baseline value for the `monitor`ed quantity. Training will stop if the `mode`l doesn't show improvement over the `baseline`.
- `restore_best_weights`: Whether to restore `mode`l weights from the epoch with the best value of the `monitor`ed quantity. If False, the `mode`l weights obtained at the last step of training are used.
#### Example:

```
 callback = tf.keras.callbacks.EarlyStopping(monitor='val_loss', patience=3)
# This callback will stop the training when there is no improvement in
# the validation loss for three consecutive epochs.
model.fit(data, labels, epochs=100, callbacks=[callback],
    validation_data=(val_data, val_labels))
```
