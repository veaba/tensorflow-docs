Callbacks: utilities called at certain points during model training.
## Classes
[class BaseLogger](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/callbacks/BaseLogger): Callback that accumulates epoch averages of metrics.

[class CSVLogger](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/callbacks/CSVLogger): Callback that streams epoch results to a csv file.

[class Callback](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/callbacks/Callback): Abstract base class used to build new callbacks.

[class EarlyStopping](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/callbacks/EarlyStopping): Stop training when a monitored quantity has stopped improving.

[class History](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/callbacks/History): Callback that records events into a History object.

[class LambdaCallback](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/callbacks/LambdaCallback): Callback for creating simple, custom callbacks on-the-fly.

[class LearningRateScheduler](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/callbacks/LearningRateScheduler): Learning rate scheduler.

[class ModelCheckpoint](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/callbacks/ModelCheckpoint): Save the model after every epoch.

[class ProgbarLogger](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/callbacks/ProgbarLogger): Callback that prints metrics to stdout.

[class ReduceLROnPlateau](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/callbacks/ReduceLROnPlateau): Reduce learning rate when a metric has stopped improving.

[class RemoteMonitor](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/callbacks/RemoteMonitor): Callback used to stream events to a server.

[class TensorBoard](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/callbacks/TensorBoard): Enable visualizations for TensorBoard.

[class TerminateOnNaN](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/callbacks/TerminateOnNaN): Callback that terminates training when a NaN loss is encountered.
