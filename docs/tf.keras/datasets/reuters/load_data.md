Loads the Reuters newswire classification dataset.
### Aliases:
- tf.compat.v1.keras.datasets.reuters.load_data
- tf.compat.v2.keras.datasets.reuters.load_data

```
 tf.keras.datasets.reuters.load_data(
    path='reuters.npz',
    num_words=None,
    skip_top=0,
    maxlen=None,
    test_split=0.2,
    seed=113,
    start_char=1,
    oov_char=2,
    index_from=3,
    **kwargs
)
```
#### Arguments:
- path: where to cache the data (relative to ~/.keras/dataset).
- num_words: max number of words to include. Words are ranked by how often they occur (in the training set) and only the most frequent words are kept
- skip_top: skip the top N most frequently occurring words (which may not be informative).
- maxlen: truncate sequences after this length.
- test_split: Fraction of the dataset to be used as test data.
- seed: random seed for sample shuffling.
- start_char: The start of a sequence will be marked with this character. Set to 1 because 0 is usually the padding character.
- oov_char: words that were cut out because of the num_words or skip_top limit will be replaced with this character.
- index_from: index actual words with this index and higher.
- **kwargs: Used for backwards compatibility.
#### Returns:
Tuple of Numpy arrays: (x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test).
Note that the 'out of vocabulary' character is only used for words that were present in the training set but are not included because they're not making the num_words cut here. Words that were not seen in the training set but are in the test set have simply been skipped.
