Constraints: functions that impose constraints on weight values.
## Classes
[class Constraint](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/constraints/Constraint)

[class MaxNorm](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/constraints/MaxNorm): MaxNorm weight constraint.

[class MinMaxNorm](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/constraints/MinMaxNorm): MinMaxNorm weight constraint.

[class NonNeg](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/constraints/NonNeg): Constrains the weights to be non-negative.

[class RadialConstraint](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/constraints/RadialConstraint): Constrains Conv2D kernel weights to be the same for each radius.

[class UnitNorm](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/constraints/UnitNorm): Constrains the weights incident to each hidden unit to have unit norm.

[class max_norm](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/constraints/MaxNorm): MaxNorm weight constraint.

[class min_max_norm](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/constraints/MinMaxNorm): MinMaxNorm weight constraint.

[class non_neg](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/constraints/NonNeg): Constrains the weights to be non-negative.
