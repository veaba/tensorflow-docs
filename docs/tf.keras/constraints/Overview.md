Constraints: functions that impose constraints on weight values.
## Classes
`class Constraint`
`class MaxNorm`: MaxNorm weight constraint.
`class MinMaxNorm`: MinMaxNorm weight constraint.
`class NonNeg`: Constrains the weights to be non-negative.
`class RadialConstraint`: Constrains `Conv2D` kernel weights to be the same for each radius.
`class UnitNorm`: Constrains the weights incident to each hidden unit to have unit norm.
`class max_norm`: MaxNorm weight constraint.
`class min_max_norm`: MinMaxNorm weight constraint.
`class non_neg`: Constrains the weights to be non-negative.
`class radial_constraint`: Constrains `Conv2D` kernel weights to be the same for each radius.
`class unit_norm`: Constrains the weights incident to each hidden unit to have unit norm.
