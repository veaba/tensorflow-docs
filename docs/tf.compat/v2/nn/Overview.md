Wrappers for primitive Neural Net (NN) Operations.
## Classes
`class RNNCellDeviceWrapper`: Operator that ensures an RNNCell runs on a particular device.
`class RNNCellDropoutWrapper`: Operator adding dropout to inputs and outputs of the given cell.
`class RNNCellResidualWrapper`: RNNCell wrapper that ensures cell inputs are added to the outputs.
