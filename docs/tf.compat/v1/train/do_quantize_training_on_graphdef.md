A general quantization scheme is being developed in `tf.contrib.quantize`.
(deprecated)

    
    
    tf.compat.v1.train.do_quantize_training_on_graphdef(
        input_graph,
        num_bits
    )
    

**Warning:** THIS FUNCTION IS DEPRECATED. It will be removed in a future
version. Instructions for updating: GraphDef quantized training rewriter is
deprecated in the long term

Consider using that instead, though since it is in the tf.contrib namespace,
it is not subject to backward compatibility guarantees.
