A general quantization scheme is being developed in tf.contrib.quantize. (deprecated)

```
 tf.compat.v1.train.do_quantize_training_on_graphdef(
    input_graph,
    num_bits
)
```

Consider using that instead, though since it is in the tf.contrib namespace, it is not subject to backward compatibility guarantees.
