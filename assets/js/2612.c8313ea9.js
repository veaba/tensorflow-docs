If not None, caches on another device. Typical use is to cache on the device where the Ops using the Variable reside, to deduplicate copying through Switch and other conditional statements. name: Optional name for the variable. Defaults to 'Variable' and gets uniquified automatically. dtype: If set, initial_value will be converted to the given type. If None, either the datatype will be kept (if initial_value is a Tensor), or convert_to_tensor will decide. constraint: A constraint function to be applied to the variable after updates by some algorithms. synchronization: Indicates when a distributed a variable will be aggregated.
